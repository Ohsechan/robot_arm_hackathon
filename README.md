## Project
This is the source code that won the Grand Prize at the hackathon organized by pinklab on September 7, 2023.
The task involved coding a control program to use a real robotic arm to rearrange a randomly stacked tower of blocks according to their colors and then rebuild it in the correct order.

## how to run code
<pre><code>python3 detect.py --weights ./runs/train/yolov3_dobot/weights/best.pt --source 0 --img 640 --conf-thres 0.5</code></pre>
